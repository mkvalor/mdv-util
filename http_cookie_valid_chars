In 6265 the cookie name is still specified as an RFC 2616 token, which means
you can pick from the alphanums plus:

!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~

In the cookie value it formally bans the (filtered by browsers) control
characters and (inconsistently-implemented) non-ASCII characters. It retains
cookie_spec's prohibition on space, comma and semicolon, plus for compat-
ibility with any poor idiots who actually implemented the earlier RFCs it
also banned backslash and quotes, other than quotes wrapping the whole value
(but in that case the quotes are still considered part of the value, not an
encoding scheme). So that leaves you with the alphanums plus:

!#$%&'()*+-./:<=>?@[]^_`{|}~

In the real world we are still using the original-and-worst Netscape
cookie_spec, so code that consumes cookies should be prepared to encounter
pretty much anything, but for code that produces cookies it is advisable to
stick with the subset in RFC 6265.
