Starting with vim 8.0, vim will automatically load plugins within a certain
directory sub-hive of the vim config directory.  The default vim config dir
is ~/.vim/  Here's how it works:

$mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack

This will create the base location for the furthur directory structure of
your desired plugins.  I say "further" here because now you should add
sub-directories at this location, with names which will describe groups of
related plugins.  The simplest scenario would be to add just one directory
that will hold all the plugins you want vim to load when it starts up,
perhaps called "myplugins".

mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/myplugins

vim will search through all the sub-dirs just below pack/ and process these
directory hives in its normal fashion for loading plugins.  This means we now
need a new sub-directory below myplugins/ named "start", if we want any plugins
to auto-load. (and/or if we want to manually load plugins in vim, we would
create a new sub-dir named "opt")

$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/myplugins/start

Once this is in place, you may now begin git cloning and/or downloading and
unzipping plugin directories you like into the start/ or opt/ directory.  When
git starts, all the plugin directories in the start/ dir will be loaded.

There is no facility in vim's native plugin support to update the plugins.
To do that, you would git pull or download/unzip in each specific plugin
subdirectory.  Obviously, you could make the myplugins/ directory a git repo
and then manage that separately, giving you the possibility of simply cloning
that repo (or a copy of it, etc, etc) to the vim config dir in a home dir on
any machine.

In my case, this can simply become a dir hive within my larger public "utils"
repo, allowing me to clone 'all my stuff' in one pull and then copy (or create
a script that copies for me) these things to the places they should go.  Yet -
maybe its' best not to duplicate the plugin code within my utils repo.  A
script could perform all the git clone and download/unzip operations at
run-time.

Appendix A: Organizing The Groups of Plugins
Perhaps: one dir of plugins that are git-cloned vs another dir that are
downloaded and unzipped.  Further, you could do this on a language-by-language
basis for plugins that are language specific, resulting in up to two dirs per
set of language-specific plugins.
